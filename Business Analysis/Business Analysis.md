**Business Analysis** 

During 2023, the store generated nearly €40 million in revenue, but the data shows a steady decline month over month, which represents a significant warning sign for the future. The analysis also revealed a high concentration of revenue in a single department and a few products, as well as a customer base with low-value purchases.

Key findings:

• 82% drop in monthly revenue between January and December.

• Department 4 accounts for 93% of revenue, representing a high level of

dependence.

• Three sections account for 92% of revenue, limiting the variety

of the offering.

• Low average order value: approximately €19.34 per order.



**Analysis details**



Monthly revenue

A significant drop was noted throughout the year: from more than 6 million in January to just over

1 million in December. This reflects the need to review what is affecting sales

and how the situation can be reversed.



**Sales by department**

Department 4 dominates almost everything, with more than €37 million in sales. This suggests excessive dependence and potential risk if this department faces challenges.



**Sales by Section**

Sections 24 (Fruit), 123 (Organic), and 83 (Vegetables) are the top sellers. Although they are very successful, relying so heavily on so few sections could be dangerous if tastes change or new competitors emerge.



**Best-selling products**

Products such as bananas and strawberries lead the way in both units sold and revenue. This suggests a customer base interested in healthy products, but also a need for alternatives if this trend changes.





**Customers and purchasing behavior**

No individual customers stand out: they all buy small quantities. This can be positive (more customers = less individual risk), but it is also an opportunity to increase the average ticket size with strategies such as cross-promotions or personalized recommendations.



**Recommendations:**

1\. Diversify departments and sections

Action: Develop strategies to promote other departments and

sections that are less represented.

Benefit: Reduce dependence and risk associated with the

current concentration

2\. Expand product variety

Action: Introduce new non-organic products and encourage the sale of

less popular products.

Benefit: Attract a broader customer base and adapt to potential

changes in market preferences.

3\. Increase average purchase value

Action: Implement an analytical recommendation system.

Benefit: Increase average revenue per customer and improve customer loyalty
